📥 Data Flow
Reddit API → Airflow → S3 (raw) →crawler - Glue (clean) - crawler → S3 (cleaned) → Redshift → Power BI

🧠 Overview
This project is a scalable Reddit Data Pipeline built with cloud-first and modular principles. Reddit posts are extracted using Python and the PRAW API, then stored as raw JSON in Amazon S3. AWS Glue cleans and deduplicates the data, writing the cleaned output back to S3. The cleaned data is then copied into Amazon Redshift using the COPY command for further analysis.

The process is fully automated using Apache Airflow DAGs and triggers. Analysts can connect Power BI directly to Redshift and build interactive reports and dashboards on Reddit activity and post metadata.

📌 Conclusion
The project showcases an end-to-end automated Reddit data pipeline using modern data engineering tools like Airflow, AWS Glue, S3, and Redshift. The pipeline is modular, serverless, and scalable, making it suitable for real-time data operations and reporting.

🔑 Highlights:
End-to-end automation
